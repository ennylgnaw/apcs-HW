Response to
Episode 1 - "Standing Up in the Milky Way"
@-------------------------------------------------
I think that the implications of Cosmos extend far beyond the confines of
science. The part where we see Giordano Bruno's demise simply because of
his different beliefs really impacted me, because no one would listen to what
he said and everyone automatically labeled him as a heretic for going against
the Roman Catholic Church. I wonder, what is it that makes humans so afraid of
change? Even though no one could know whether Bruno was right or wrong at the
time, they couldn't even consider the possibility that perhaps he was right.
I think it's just another flaw of humanity that we must fight, though I don't
think it can ever be vanquished completely. In America, the end of slavery took
a lot of bloodshed and disagreement; yet even now, racism in America still runs
rampant and its roots are still embedded in the most fundamental parts of
society (direct racial slurs are only the tip of the iceberg). And many people
condemn the Communist Revolutions for their violence and mustache-twirling
dictators, but for all its flaws and less-than-ideal implentations, it has
helped usher the East into the modern era and assisted with toppling the
aristocracies of the past. Change yields less than perfect effects. But it
brings the opportunity for something new.

In a sense, the Roman Catholic Church was right to lock up and burn dissenters
because their control and power depended on absolute trust and belief. They are
certainly less powerful today than in the 15th and 16th centuries. Knowledge
and opinions are empowering.

On another note, it is a little sad that only in posterity we honor those who
dared to think differently.

Is there a limit to how far we can imagine the extent of the universe?
How do we wrap our minds around the idea of infinity, when so much that we
see in life is finite?
What existed before the Big Bang?
Will we ever be able to make something that goes faster than the speed of light?

Episode 3 - "When Knowledge Conquered Fear"
@-------------------------------------------------
I wonder if humanity will still exist on Earth to see the Milky Way-Andromeda
Collision, and if so, how much we would have changed. Who knows what will
happen in those billion years? If something cause humans to go extinct as the
dinosaurs did, or how evolution would run its course? There is some comfort in
knowing that none of us will be alive to see that future, supposing that it
is far away.

This video first exposed me to the conflict between Robert Hooke and Isaac
Newton. History makes big names out of them, listing out their spectacular
accomplishments, but these petty rivalries and blatant lies are what bring
them back to earth (no pun intended) and show that they are flawed, just
like any other human.

I wonder what it's like to invent calculus.
