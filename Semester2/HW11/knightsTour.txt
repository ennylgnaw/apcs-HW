Express your algorithm for generating a sequence of moves a knight may
make to touch each square of an n*n grid exactly once --- or to determine
that this task is impossible.

Idea: Use an algo similar to that of the QueenBoard problem.

Algo:
1) Check to see if all spots on the board have been traversed.
2) If spots all traversed, print solution
3) If spots not all traversed, from the most recent knight position,
   a) make another move with the knight if moves can be made (knight can
      make 8 moves).
   b) If moves can't be made, remove the knight from the current position
      and try other moves.
   c) If no paths can be found, return false. If the first item we
      placed on the board returns false, no solutions exist.
